    You can write regular markdown here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage. I strongly encourage you to take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown - it&rsquo;ll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.
Here is some bold text
Here is a secondary heading Here&rsquo;s a useless table:
   Number Next number Previous number     Five Six Four   Ten Eleven Nine   Seven Eight Six   Two Three One    How about a yummy crepe?

    Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?

      To be
    </a>
  </h2>
  
    To be, or not to be&ndash;that is the question: Whether &lsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep&ndash; No more&ndash;and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. &lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep&ndash; To sleep&ndash;perchance to dream: ay, there&rsquo;s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.

    What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&rsquo;t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don&rsquo;t go to school with her; it&rsquo;s the only way I can stay alive! I&rsquo;m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).

    From Wikipedia:
Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world&rsquo;s most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.

      Pirates arrrr

  </h2>
  
    Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.
